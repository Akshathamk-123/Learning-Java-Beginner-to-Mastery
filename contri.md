###Problems While Installing I faced
1) Now that I had install Java several times I faced the issue of:
        When I typed java --version in the cmd; It would show nothing 
    How to resolve it is to go to the settings in the windows and go to apps 
    Uninstall all the other packages that were there of Java and then reinstall
